Use dispense to run claude code on the same github issue with two different models: sonet and opus.
Create remote sandboxes.
The github issue is: https://github.com/daytonaio/daytona/issues/2283
After creating sandboxes, wait for both to complete the task.
After the tasks have completed, inspect the task logs.
Based on the log, inspect the changes in the files and compare both tasks to determine which model was more accurate.
